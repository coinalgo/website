Hello, I am _Nikhil G._, a Ruby developer by heart who has recently
fallen in love with the abundant data and APIs in the cryptocurrency
ecosystem. As has been my primary passion, I am intrigued by API
integrations and data analysis, which naturally, draw me to create this
website.

If you've some ideas to share, some analysis that you worked on or would
like to discover in depth but don't know how to write the code, please
send me a shout out and I will try to help in whatever I can.

I would love to get introduced to you, if you are an experienced
cryptocurrency trader, investor or a geek into the cryptocurrency world.

You can always contact me on my [Github](http://github.com/nikhgupta)
account for anything tech related, or otherwise, simply email me at:
me@nikhgupta.com for any work queries.
